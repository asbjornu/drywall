# Drywall Development notes

This document contains information on development ideas as well as
HOWTOs for specific tasks and style guides which inform how the code is
developed for the site. This will be adjusted over time

## Style Guides/ Standards

Here are a list of style guides and standards found and used for
this drywall site.

# [Google JSON Style Guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jsoncstyleguide.xml)

## HOWTOs:

### HOWTO Add a filter to the requests admin (http://<host>/admin/requests)

1. In `views/admin/requests/index.jade`, add a filter to the list of filters
   in the Underscore template id `tmpl-filters`. Note; there are currently 6
   filter boxes on this page, so if more are to be added, it might be good
   to have a UI person check those out.

2. In the `find()` function in `views/admin/requests/index.js`, the query that
	 returns the requests to the frontend is the [Sequelize](http://sequelize.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) [findAll()](http://sequelize.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/querying/#where)
	 function. This is located in the getResults() function expression.

	 Currently, certain query parameters are used for certain filters.
	 * The `beginDate` and `endDate` params are used for date range filtering

	 * The `search` param is used for an ILIKE query.

	 * The `offset` and `limit` params are used for limiting ranges

	 * The `region` param is used to filter by region

	 Each of these maps to a [Sequelize operator](http://sequelize.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/querying/#operators) or clause.

	 * `beginDate` and `endDate` are used with the $between operator.

	 * `offset` and `limit` are optional parameters to the findAll query
